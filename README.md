This repository contains my project completed during the **Forage Virtual Internship**.  
The goal was to design a no-code predictive modeling framework using **Generative AI** to solve customer delinquency risk ( late payments issues ).  

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features
- Collected and explored important variables automatically
- Suggested an AI-based and fair strategy for collections
- Checked how well the model works using main classification metrics 

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents
- `notebooks/` â†’ Jupyter Notebook(s) for model logic and evaluation  
- `certificate/` â†’ Certificate of completion (PDF/PNG)  
- `slides/` â†’ AI-powered collections strategy presentation (PPTX)  
- `README.md` â†’ Project overview  

## ðŸ“œ Certificate
The official certificate of completion is included in this repository. ( https://drive.google.com/file/d/1c9iiKko-tMdEAMw44TUClfEFbB60Nihy/view?usp=sharing )  

## ðŸš€ About
This project demonstrates the application of **Generative AI** for social and financial data analysis, with a focus on scalable, ethical, and effective debt management strategies.
