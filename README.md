This repository contains my project completed during the **Forage Virtual Internship**.  
The goal was to design a no-code predictive modeling framework using **Generative AI** to evaluate customer delinquency risk.  

## ðŸ”‘ Key Features
- Automated feature selection and model logic  
- Performance measured through key classification metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)  
- Ethical AI and compliance considerations  
- Proposed AI-driven collections strategy  

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents
- `notebooks/` â†’ Jupyter Notebook(s) for model logic and evaluation  
- `certificate/` â†’ Certificate of completion (PDF/PNG)  
- `slides/` â†’ AI-powered collections strategy presentation (PPTX)
